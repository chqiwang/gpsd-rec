# Official code of GPSD

## GPSD
The GPSD (**G**enerative **P**retraining for **S**calable **D**iscriminative Recommendation) framework, proposed in the KDD25 paper [Scaling Transformers for Discriminative Recommendation via Generative Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03699), aims to scale up Transformer for discriminative recommendation tasks like CTR and CVR prediction, which play key roles in modern industrial recommendation systems.
The framework consists of two stages: 1) the generative pretraining stage and 2) the discriminative training stage. In the generative pretraining stage, a Transformer is trained to autoregressively predict the next item in user behavior sequences, similar to training a language model. In the discriminative training stage, the pretrained parameters are fully or partially transferred to initialize a discriminative model, which is then trained to predict user actions, taking user behavior items and a candidate item as input. We also use Transformer in the discriminative stage but other architectures are also adoptable. In the second training stage, sparse parameters are frozen to prevent overfitting and thus facilitate model scalability.

## Train model

Available MODEL_IDs: deepfm, din, dien, dmin, l4h32a4, l4h64a4, l4h128a4, l4h256a4

Note: l4h32a4, l4h64a4 and l4h128a4, l4h256a4 are Transformer-based models.

### Amazon-food
- Training baseline models
```
python ./src/train.py --config ./config/amazon_food/[MODEL_ID].gin
```

- GPSD: Pretraining
```
python ./src/train.py --config ./config/amazon_food/[MODEL_ID]_pretrain.gin
```
Available MODEL_IDs for pretraining are: l4h32a4, l4h64a4, l4h128a4, l4h256a4

- GPSD: Discriminative training
```
python ./src/train.py --config ./config/amazon_food/[MODEL_ID]_stsf.gin
